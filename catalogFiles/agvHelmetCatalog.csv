The graphics that feature on the helmet are dominated by a sizable number 1  which appears on the front of the shell. This livery is unique  as Rossi has always favored the number 46  his historic race number. Despite his nine world titles  Valentino has never raced with number 1 on the fairing of his bike  and has always relegated it to a more minor “detail” on his racing suits. The sides and top of the helmet bear five stars  representing the Championships won by Rossi. Meanwhile  the classic sun image appears on the back of the shell  this time in a “tribal” design against an orange background. , 100% carbon fiber shell , Four shell sizes and five-density EPS developed in four sizes , Shell and EPS structure designed to minimize rotational accelerations (FIM homologated) , Collarbone safe profile , Detachable PRO Spoiler , Race suit fitment , Metal air vents and extractors (five front vents and two rear extractors) , Visor has 190° horizontal field of view and 85° vertical field of view , Scratch-resistant clear visor with wide field of vision with tear-off pins  ready and suitable for tear-off shields , 5mm thick visor is class 1 optical standard approved for excellent vision , 100% Max Vision Pinlock (120) included , XQRS (Extra Quick Release System) so you can replace the shield in seconds without the use of tools , Metal visor mechanism and patented visor lock system , Cheek pads: Shalimar fabric for soft and stable fit even at high speed , Crown pad: elastic and breathable microfiber , Neck roll: breathable fabric with elastic and waterproof inserts , Sanitized: antibacterial protection , 2Dry: instant sweat absorption , Microsense: premium skin comfort , 360° Adaptive fit , Three-piece adaptable crown pad fit , No stitches in sensitive areas , Embracing neck roll profile
